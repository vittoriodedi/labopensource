This repository contains some of my *Laboratorio Open Source* course materials. In particular, it includes the final presentation I delivered during the exam, as well as detailed notes on the different business models that can be adopted to sustain open source projects.

## Contents

* 📄 `Presentazione Esposizione.pdf` – Final presentation used during the exam. It provides a summary of the key insights from the course, including how I took my first steps in the open source world and the main strategies for sustaining and monetizing open source initiatives.

* 📄 `Appunti_Modelli_Business.txt` – A structured collection of notes based on the talk by Michael Meeks (SFSCON 2022 keynote) and class discussions. It covers the main open source business models, their pros and cons, and real-world examples. These notes explore models such as:

  * Consulting-based business
  * Open Core
  * Collateral sales (CDs, books, guides)
  * Enterprise support
  * Donations and transparency
  * Dual licensing and SaaS offerings
  * Community dynamics and sustainability challenges

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal mini-archive of my experience and learning during the *Laboratorio Open Source* course. It reflects both theoretical concepts and practical insights into how open source software can be economically viable while staying true to its core values of openness and collaboration.
